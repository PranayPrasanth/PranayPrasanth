## 🧪 Notable Projects  

### 🏘️ Airbnb Data-Driven Pricing and Revenue Strategy  
**Tools:** Power BI, Statistical Modeling, Python, Financial Analysis  

- **Identified Dual Driver Strategy:** Conducted extensive market analysis across 57,000+ London listings, determining that property characteristics drive listing price, while customer experience metrics are the dominant factors for revenue maximization.  
- **Quantified Superhost Advantage:** Statistically validated (p < 0.0001) that Superhosts command a 9.1% pricing premium and realize 125% higher average revenue, driven by superior amenities and 2x the guest engagement.  
- **Actionable Business Intelligence:** Designed a Power BI dashboard advising stakeholders on optimal guest capacity (high-demand 1–4 guests) and identifying high-yield geographic "sweet spots" for maximized ROI.

### 📈 JPMorgan Chase Quantitative Research Simulation  
**Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, ARIMA, K-Means, Logistic Regression  

- Built quantitative models for asset pricing (ARIMA for natural gas forecasting, valuing gas storage contracts for up to 200 units) to identify trading opportunities and inform strategic investment decisions.  
- Developed credit risk models (Logistic Regression for default prediction, FICO bucketing via K-Means for 10 risk buckets) enabling data-driven commercial decisions and financial exposure mitigation.

### 🔍 HR Attrition Prediction  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Random Forest, Jupyter Notebook  

- Developed and compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest models for employee attrition prediction (~15,000 records), with Random Forest achieving a superior AUC of 98%.  
- Conducted in-depth EDA and identified critical attrition drivers (satisfaction, tenure, projects) to inform targeted retention strategies. These strategies could hypothetically reduce annual churn by 15–20%, translating to an estimated annual cost savings of $120K+ in recruitment and training.
